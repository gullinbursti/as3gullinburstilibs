First, mass movement (1) - linear motion 
1) uniformly variable motion 
1. The average speed V flat = s / t (defined) 2. A useful inference Vt2-Vo2 = 2as 
3. Intermediate times the speed Vt / 2 = V flat = (Vt + Vo) / 2 4. Terminal velocity Vt = Vo + at 
5. The middle position, velocity Vs / 2 = [(Vo2 + Vt2) / 2] 1 / 2 6. Displacement s = V level t = Vot + at2 / 2 = Vt/2t 
7. Acceleration a = (Vt-Vo) / t (to Vo is a positive direction, a and Vo in the same direction (accelerate) a> 0; reverse is a <0) 
8. Experimental inference Δs = aT2 (Δs adjacent consecutive equal time (T)) the difference in displacement 
9. The main physical quantities and units: the initial velocity (Vo): m / s; acceleration (a): m/s2; terminal velocity (Vt): m / s; time (t) s (s); displacement (s): meters (m); distance: m; speed unit conversion: 1m / s = 3.6km / h. 
Note: 
(1) The average speed is a vector; 
(2) a large object velocity and acceleration are not necessarily large; 
(3) a = (Vt-Vo) / t is only measured style, not determined pattern; 
(4) other related elements: mass, displacement and distance, frame of reference, time, and always see Volume P19 〔〕 / s-t diagram, v-t graph / speed and speed, instantaneous speed, see Volume P24 〔〕 . 
2) free fall 
1. The initial velocity Vo = 0 2. Terminal velocity Vt = gt 
3. Drop height h = gt2 / 2 (down from the position of calculated Vo) 4. Inference Vt2 = 2gh 
Note: 
(1) free fall with zero initial velocity is uniformly rectilinearly accelerating, following the law of uniformly variable motion; 
(2) a = g = 9.8m/s2 ≈ 10m/s2 (acceleration of gravity at the equator near the small office in the mountains than the flat is small, the direction of straight down). 
(3) vertical Thrown 
1. Displacement s = Vot-gt2 / 2 2. Terminal velocity Vt = Vo-gt (g = 9.8m/s2 ≈ 10m/s2) 
3. Useful inference Vt2-Vo2 =- 2gs 4. Increase the maximum height Hm = Vo2/2g (throw point date) 
5. From time t = 2Vo / g (from throwing off the back of the original location of the time) 
Note: 
(1) the whole process of treatment: is the uniform linear motion deceleration to upward direction is positive, negative acceleration to take; 
(2) sub-treatment: up to uniform linear motion slow down as the free fall, with the symmetry; 
(3) increase and the whereabouts of the process of symmetry, such as the speed of the equivalent point in the same reverse so. 

Second, particle movement (2) - curve movement, gravity 
1) Horizontal Projectile Motion 
1. Horizontal speed: Vx = Vo 2. Vertical speed: Vy = gt 
3. Horizontal displacement: x = Vot 4. Vertical displacement: y = gt2 / 2 
5. Exercise time t = (2y / g) 1 / 2 (Usually, that is (2h / g) 1 / 2) 
6. Closing Velocity Vt = (Vx2 + Vy2) 1 / 2 = [Vo2 + (gt) 2] 1 / 2 
Combined level of speed and the angle between the direction of β: tgβ = Vy / Vx = gt/V0 
7. Joint displacement: s = (x2 + y2) 1 / 2, 
Displacement angle between the direction and level of α: tgα = y / x = gt/2Vo 
8. Horizontal acceleration: ax = 0; vertical acceleration: ay = g 
Note: 
(1) Horizontal Projectile Motion is a uniformly variable curve movement, acceleration g, usually seen as horizontal and vertical uniform linear transport direction of the synthesis of free fall; 
(2) movement time from the drop height h (y) the decision has nothing to do with the level of throwing speed; 
(3) θ and β of the relationship tgβ = 2tgα; 
(4) Horizontal Projectile Motion in time t is the key to solving problems; (5) movement of an object must have to do curve acceleration, direction and suffer together when the speed (acceleration) is not in a straight line direction, the object in curvilinear motion. 
2) uniform circular motion 
1. Linear velocity V = s / t = 2πr / T 2. Angular velocity ω = Φ / t = 2π / T = 2πf 
3. Centripetal acceleration a = V2 / r = ω2r = (2π / T) 2r 4. Centripetal force F heart = mV2 / r = mω2r = mr (2π / T) 2 = mωv = F Hop 
5. Cycle and frequency: T = 1 / f 6. Angular velocity and linear velocity relationship: V = ωr 
7. The relationship between angular velocity and rotation speed ω = 2πn (here meaning the same frequency and speed) 
8. The main physical quantities and units: arc length (s): meter (m); angle (Φ): radian (rad); frequency (f): He (Hz); cycle (T): seconds (s); speed ( n): r / s; radius (r): m (m); linear velocity (V): m / s; angular velocity (ω): rad / s; to the centripetal acceleration: m/s2. 
Note: 
(1) the centripetal force can be provided by a specific force can also be provided by the force can also be provided by the pitch, the direction is always perpendicular to the direction and speed, point to center of a circle; 
(2) make uniform circular motion of the object, the centripetal force equal to, and centripetal force only change the direction of speed, the speed does not change the size of the object's kinetic energy remains unchanged, therefore, the centripetal force is not acting, but the momentum is changing. 
3) Gravity 
1. Kepler's third law: T2/R3 = K (= 4π2/GM) (R: the radius of curvature, T: period, K: constant (and independent of planet mass, depending on the quality of central celestial body)) 
2. Law of universal gravitation: F = Gm1m2/r2 (G = 6.67 × 10-11N • m2/kg2, the direction in which the connection) 
3. Celestial body gravity and gravity: GMm/R2 = mg; g = GM/R2 (R: celestial radius (m), M: celestial mass (kg)) 
4. Satellite orbiting speed, velocity, cycle: V = (GM / r) 1 / 2; ω = (GM/r3) 1 / 2; T = 2π (r3/GM) 1 / 2 (M: Central Objects quality ) 
5. The first (b, c) space velocity V1 = (g to r to) 1 / 2 = (GM / r in) 1 / 2 = 7.9km / s; V2 = 11.2km / s; V3 = 16.7km / s 
6. Geosynchronous satellite GMm / (r to + h) 2 = m4π2 (r to + h) / T2 (h ≈ 36000km, h: the height from the Earth's surface, r to: the radius of the Earth) 
Note: 
(1) celestial motion provided the required centripetal force from the gravitation, F = F 10 000 to;
(2) application of the law of gravity can estimate the object's mass and density; 
(3) Geostationary satellites can only run in the equator, running the same cycle and Earth's rotation period; 
(4) satellite orbit radius decreases, potential energy becomes smaller, larger kinetic energy, speed, larger and smaller cycle (with 3 anti); 
(5) surround the Earth's largest satellite launch speed and minimum speed are 7.9km / s. 

Third, force (a common force, the synthesis and decomposition)

9. Lorentz force f = qVBsinθ (θ is the angle between B and V, when V ⊥ B when: f = qVB, V / / B Time: f = 0) 
Note: 
(1) by the spring stiffness k, the decision itself; 
(2) the friction coefficient μ and the pressure is independent of the size and the contact area, the contact surface material properties and surface condition of such decisions;

2. Synthesis Internet into a point of strength: 
F = (F12 + F22 +2 F1F2cosα) 1 / 2 (Cosine) F1 ⊥ F2 time: F = (F12 + F22) 1 / 2 
3. Force size range: | F1-F2 | ≤ F ≤ | F1 + F2 | 
4. Force orthogonal decomposition: Fx = Fcosβ, Fy = Fsinβ (β together with the x-axis for the angle between the tgβ = Fy / Fx) 
Note: 
(1) force (vector) to follow the synthesis and decomposition of the parallelogram rule; 
(2) the relationship between force and the pitch is equivalent substitutes can be used together to contribute to the common role of alternative and vice versa have also set up; 
(3) In addition to formula, but also used as a map method, this time to select the scale, rigorous mapping; 
(4) F1 and F2 values of a certain time, F1 and F2 of the angle (α angle) the greater the force is smaller; 
(5) along the same line power synthesis, can take the positive direction along a straight line, with a sign that the direction of force, simplify the algebra.
